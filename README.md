Sonality Framework
</h1>

---

Sonality is a framework in development that will allow UI designers to build web interfaces that match their brand's visual guidelines while leveraging the agility offered by using a component library.

Component libraries are often avoided by developers due to their low customizability. Sonality is focused on making styling easy, while handling most of the boilerplate logic necessary to create useful and well structured components.
